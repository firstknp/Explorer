### Description
This application provides a customizable web-based evaluation form with data summarization and status reporting.  Event organizers can create a custom form for their event containing a list of entrants (contestants, projects, presentors, performers, etc) and a set of criteria that they are to be rated on. Criteria may also include guidance (help) on ratings.  There may optionally be space for entering comments.
